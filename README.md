# Improv Buddy

A little Lisp program from my college course on Artificial Intelligence and Music, taught by David Cope at UCSC.

I'm not sure how to make any of this run any more since it depends on the outdated MCL and a library called MidiShare.

So this is just up here for vanity and curiosity. ;)
